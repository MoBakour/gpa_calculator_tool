A tool with clean and easy-to-use design that allows you to enter your grades and come back for them later without having to manually save anything, and without having to worry about re-entering anything. The tool also allows you to set your own institution's grading scheme so that you get the most accurate GPA calculations that are compatible with your systems and curriculums.
